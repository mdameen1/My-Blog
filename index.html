    <!-- paragraph tag -->
    Khabib Abdulmanapovich Nurmagomedov[a] (born 20 September 1988) is a Russian former professional mixed martial artist who competed in the Lightweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). He was the longest-reigning UFC Lightweight Champion ever, having held the title from April 2018 to March 2021. With 29 wins and no losses, he retired with an undefeated record.[8] Nurmagomedov is widely considered to be among the greatest mixed martial artists of all time,[9][10][11][12][13] and was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame on June 30, 2022.[14]

    A two-time world champion in combat sambo, Nurmagomedov has a background in wrestling, judo, and sambo. Nurmagomedov was ranked #1 in the UFC men's pound-for-pound rankings at the time of his retirement,[15] until being removed following his title vacation in March 2021.[16] Fight Matrix ranks him as the #1 lightweight of all time.[17] In 2019, Forbes ranked Nurmagomedov as the No. 1 most successful Russian athlete; Nurmagomedov also topped the list of the 40 most successful Russian show business and sports personalities under 40.[18][19]
    
    Nurmagomedov is also a mixed martial arts trainer and promoter, known for founding Eagles MMA and promoting the Eagle Fighting Championship (EFC). After retirement, he transitioned to being a full-time coach and cornerman before retiring from the sport completely in January 2023.[3][20][21] Throughout his career, Nurmagomedov has become the subject of many controversies, including a longstanding affiliation with Chechnya's leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, questionable affiliations with oligarchs, advocacy for increased cultural censorship and misogynism. </p>
